{"prediction":"To determine the instrument to person ratio for both Badly Drawn Boy and Wolf Alice, we need to consider the number of instruments played relative to the number of people in each act.\n\nFor Badly Drawn Boy (Damon Michael Gough), he is a solo artist but is known as a multi-instrumentalist. The specific number of instruments he plays isn't detailed in the provided context, but given that he is credited with writing, producing, and playing several instruments on his album \"The Hour of Bewilderbeast,\" it's clear he plays multiple instruments. However, for the sake of this calculation, we'll consider him as one person playing multiple instruments, but without a specific number, we can't accurately calculate his instrument to person ratio beyond knowing it is greater than 1.\n\nWolf Alice, on the other hand, is a four-piece band with each member presumably playing at least one primary instrument: Ellie Rowsell (vocals, guitar), Joff Oddie (guitars, vocals), Theo Ellis (bass), and Joel Amey (drums, vocals). This setup suggests a minimum instrument to person ratio of 1:1, assuming each member only plays one instrument, which is common in rock bands. However, given that members are listed with multiple roles (e.g., vocals and guitar), the ratio could be slightly higher if members regularly switch instruments or have secondary instruments they play. \n\nWithout specific numbers on the exact count of instruments played by Badly Drawn Boy in a performance or recording setting, it's difficult to make a precise comparison. However, based on the information that Badly Drawn Boy is a multi-instrumentalist and assuming he plays more than one instrument in his performances or recordings, it's likely that Badly Drawn Boy has a higher instrument to person ratio than Wolf Alice, simply because he is one person responsible for multiple instruments. Wolf Alice, being a four-member band, would have a ratio that suggests a more distributed approach to instrumentation, likely hovering around or slightly above 1:1, depending on their live performance setup and whether members play multiple instruments during their shows.","human_eval":1,"yi_eval":1,"yi_ablated_eval":1,"mix_eval":-1.0}
