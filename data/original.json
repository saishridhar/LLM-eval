Lending institutions could make one or more of these changes to relieve financial pressure on borrowers to prevent the condition of foreclosure.  Loan modifications have been practiced in the United States since The 2008 Crash Of The Housing Market from Washington Mutual, Chase Home Finance, Chase, JP Morgan & Chase, other contributors like MER's.  Crimes of Mortgage ad Real Estate Staff had long assisted nd finally the squeaky will could not continue as their deviant practices broke the state and crashed.  Modification owners either ordered by The United States Department of Housing, The United States IRS or President Obamas letters from Note Holders came to those various departments asking for the Democratic process to help them keep their homes and protection them from explosion.  Thus the birth of Modifications.  It is yet to date for clarity how theses enforcements came into existence and except b whom, but t is certain that note holders form the Midwest reached out in the Democratic Process for assistance.  FBI Mortgage Fraud Department came into existence.  Modifications HMAP HARP were also birthed to help note holders get Justice through reduced mortgage by making terms legal.  Modification of mortgage terms was introduced by IRS staff addressing the crisis called the HAMP TEAMS that went across the United States desiring the new products to assist homeowners that were victims of predatory lending practices, unethical staff, brokers, attorneys and lenders that contributed to the crash.  Modification were a fix to the crash as litigation has ensued as the lenders reorganized and renamed the lending institutions and government agencies are to closely monitor them.  Prior to modifications loan holders that experiences crisis would use Loan assumptions and Loan transfers to keep the note in the 1930s.  During the Great Depression, loan transfers, loan assumption, and loan bail out programs took place at the state level in an effort to reduce levels of loan foreclosures while the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Federal Trade Commission, Comptroller, the United States Government and State Government responded to lending institution violations of law in these arenas by setting public court records that are legal precedence of such illegal actions.  The legal precedents and reporting agencies were created to address the violations of laws to consumers while the Modifications were created to assist the consumers that are victims of predatory lending practices.  During the so-called \"Great Recession\" of the early 21st century, loan modification became a matter of national policy, with various actions taken to alter mortgage loan terms to prevent further economic destabilization.  Due to absorbent personal profits nothing has been done to educate Homeowners or Creditors that this money from equity, escrow is truly theirs the Loan Note Holder and it is their monetary rights as the real prize and reason for the Housing Crash was the profit n obtaining the mortgage holders Escrow.  The Escrow and Equity that is accursed form the Note Holders payments various staff through the United States claimed as recorded and cashed by all staff in real-estate from local residential Tax Assessing Staff, Real Estate Staff, Ordinance Staff, Police Staff, Brokers, attorneys, lending institutional staff but typically Attorneys who are also typically the owners or Rental properties that are trained through Bankruptcies'.  that collect the Escrow that is rightfully the Homeowners but because most Homeowners are unaware of what money is due them and how they can loose their escrow.  Most Creditors are unaware that as the note holder that the Note Holder are due a annual or semi annual equity check and again bank or other lending and or legal intuitions staff claim this monies instead.  This money Note Holders were unaware of is the prize of real estate and the cause of the Real Estate Crash of 2008 where Lending Institutions provided mortgages to people years prior they know they would eventually loose with Loan holders purchasing Balloon Mortgages lending product that is designed to make fast money off the note holder whom is always typically unaware of their escrow, equity and that are further victimized by conferences and books on HOW TO MAKE MONEY IN REAL STATE - when in fact the money is the Note Holder.  The key of the crash was not the House, but the loan product used and the interest and money that was accrued form the note holders that staff too immorally.  The immoral and illegal actions of predatory lending station and their staff began with the inception of balloon mortgages although illegal activity has always existed in the arena, yet the crash created \"Watch Dog\" like HAMP TEAM, IRS, COMPTROLLER< Federal Trade Commission Consumer Protection Bureau, FBI, CIA, Local Police Department, ICE ( The FBI online Computer crime division receives and investigates computer crimes that record keeping staff from title companies, lending institutional staff, legal staff and others created fraudulent documents to change payments and billing of note holders to obtain the money note holders are typically unaware of) and other watch dog agencies came into existence to examine if houses were purchased through a processed check at Government Debited office as many obtained free homes illegally.  Many were incarcerated for such illegal actions.  Modifications fixed the Notes to proper lower interest, escrow, tax fees that staff typically raised for no reason.  Many people from various arenas involved in reals estate have been incarcerated for these actions as well as other illegal actions like charging for a modification.  Additionally Modifications were also made to address the falsifications such as inappropriate mortgage charges, filing of fraudulently deeds, reporting of and at times filing of fraudulent mortgages that were already paid off that were fraudulently continued by lenders staff and attorneys or brokers or anyone in the Real Estate Chain through the issues of real estate terms to continue to violate United States Laws, contract law and legal precedence where collusion was often done again to defraud and steal from the Note Holder was such a common practice that was evidence as to why the Mortgage Crash in 2008 occurred for the purpose of wining the prize of stealing form Homeowners and those that foreclosed was actually often purposefully for these monies note holders were unaware of to be obtained which was why Balloon mortgages and loans were given to the staff in the Real Estate Market with the hoper and the expectation that the loan holders would default as it offered opportunity to commit illegal transactions of obtaining the homeowners funds.  While such scams were addressed through modifications in 2008.  The Market relied heavily on Consumers ignorance to prosper, ignorance of real estate terms, ignorance on what they were to be charged properly for unethical financial gain and while staff in real estates lending arenas mingled terms to deceive y deliberate confusion consumers out of cash and homes while the USA Government provided Justice through President Obamas Inception and IRS Inception of Modifications which addressed these unethical profits in Reals Estate.  It was in 2009 that HARP, HAMP and Modifications were introduced to stop the victimization of Note Holders.  Taking on the Banks that ran USA Government was a great and dangerous undertaking that made America Great Again as Justice for Consumers reigned.  Legal action taken against institutions that have such business practices can be viewed in State Code of Law and Federal Law on precedent cases that are available to the public.  Finally, It had been unlawful to be charged by an attorney to modify as well as fro banking staff to modify terms to increase a mortgage and or change lending product to a balloon in an concerted effort to make homeowner foreclose which is also illegal, computer fraud and not the governments intended purpose or definition of a modification.\n\nCase Gym: Case Gym is a 1,800-seat multi-purpose arena at Boston University in Boston, Massachusetts.

The project's cost was $43 million.  Of that amount, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) contributed 80-90 percent of the project cost.  KDOT and MoDOT shared the remaining cost.

Since it would be too expensive to cover all the major highways in the Kansas City metro (which has more miles of highway per person than any other metropolitan area in the United States), studies were conducted to determine which highways or segments of highways have priority due to higher accident rates.  Since the project's beginning, it has expanded greatly, and will continue to expand.

Loan modifications have been practiced in the United States since The 2008 Crash Of The Housing Market from Washington Mutual, Chase Home Finance, Chase, JP Morgan & Chase, other contributors like MER's.  Crimes of Mortgage ad Real Estate Staff had long assisted nd finally the squeaky will could not continue as their deviant practices broke the state and crashed.  Modification owners either ordered by The United States Department of Housing, The United States IRS or President Obamas letters from Note Holders came to those various departments asking for the Democratic process to help them keep their homes and protection them from explosion.  Thus the birth of Modifications.  It is yet to date for clarity how theses enforcements came into existence and except b whom, but t is certain that note holders form the Midwest reached out in the Democratic Process for assistance.  FBI Mortgage Fraud Department came into existence.  Modifications HMAP HARP were also birthed to help note holders get Justice through reduced mortgage by making terms legal.  Modification of mortgage terms was introduced by IRS staff addressing the crisis called the HAMP TEAMS that went across the United States desiring the new products to assist homeowners that were victims of predatory lending practices, unethical staff, brokers, attorneys and lenders that contributed to the crash.  Modification were a fix to the crash as litigation has ensued as the lenders reorganized and renamed the lending institutions and government agencies are to closely monitor them.  Prior to modifications loan holders that experiences crisis would use Loan assumptions and Loan transfers to keep the note in the 1930s.  During the Great Depression, loan transfers, loan assumption, and loan bail out programs took place at the state level in an effort to reduce levels of loan foreclosures while the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Federal Trade Commission, Comptroller, the United States Government and State Government responded to lending institution violations of law in these arenas by setting public court records that are legal precedence of such illegal actions.  The legal precedents and reporting agencies were created to address the violations of laws to consumers while the Modifications were created to assist the consumers that are victims of predatory lending practices.  During the so-called \"Great Recession\" of the early 21st century, loan modification became a matter of national policy, with various actions taken to alter mortgage loan terms to prevent further economic destabilization.  Due to absorbent personal profits nothing has been done to educate Homeowners or Creditors that this money from equity, escrow is truly theirs the Loan Note Holder and it is their monetary rights as the real prize and reason for the Housing Crash was the profit n obtaining the mortgage holders Escrow.  The Escrow and Equity that is accursed form the Note Holders payments various staff through the United States claimed as recorded and cashed by all staff in real-estate from local residential Tax Assessing Staff, Real Estate Staff, Ordinance Staff, Police Staff, Brokers, attorneys, lending institutional staff but typically Attorneys who are also typically the owners or Rental properties that are trained through Bankruptcies'.  that collect the Escrow that is rightfully the Homeowners but because most Homeowners are unaware of what money is due them and how they can loose their escrow.  Most Creditors are unaware that as the note holder that the Note Holder are due a annual or semi annual equity check and again bank or other lending and or legal intuitions staff claim this monies instead.  This money Note Holders were unaware of is the prize of real estate and the cause of the Real Estate Crash of 2008 where Lending Institutions provided mortgages to people years prior they know they would eventually loose with Loan holders purchasing Balloon Mortgages lending product that is designed to make fast money off the note holder whom is always typically unaware of their escrow, equity and that are further victimized by conferences and books on HOW TO MAKE MONEY IN REAL STATE - when in fact the money is the Note Holder.  The key of the crash was not the House, but the loan product used and the interest and money that was accrued form the note holders that staff too immorally.  The immoral and illegal actions of predatory lending station and their staff began with the inception of balloon mortgages although illegal activity has always existed in the arena, yet the crash created \"Watch Dog\" like HAMP TEAM, IRS, COMPTROLLER< Federal Trade Commission Consumer Protection Bureau, FBI, CIA, Local Police Department, ICE ( The FBI online Computer crime division receives and investigates computer crimes that record keeping staff from title companies, lending institutional staff, legal staff and others created fraudulent documents to change payments and billing of note holders to obtain the money note holders are typically unaware of) and other watch dog agencies came into existence to examine if houses were purchased through a processed check at Government Debited office as many obtained free homes illegally.  Many were incarcerated for such illegal actions.  Modifications fixed the Notes to proper lower interest, escrow, tax fees that staff typically raised for no reason.  Many people from various arenas involved in reals estate have been incarcerated for these actions as well as other illegal actions like charging for a modification.  Additionally Modifications were also made to address the falsifications such as inappropriate mortgage charges, filing of fraudulently deeds, reporting of and at times filing of fraudulent mortgages that were already paid off that were fraudulently continued by lenders staff and attorneys or brokers or anyone in the Real Estate Chain through the issues of real estate terms to continue to violate United States Laws, contract law and legal precedence where collusion was often done again to defraud and steal from the Note Holder was such a common practice that was evidence as to why the Mortgage Crash in 2008 occurred for the purpose of wining the prize of stealing form Homeowners and those that foreclosed was actually often purposefully for these monies note holders were unaware of to be obtained which was why Balloon mortgages and loans were given to the staff in the Real Estate Market with the hoper and the expectation that the loan holders would default as it offered opportunity to commit illegal transactions of obtaining the homeowners funds.  While such scams were addressed through modifications in 2008.  The Market relied heavily on Consumers ignorance to prosper, ignorance of real estate terms, ignorance on what they were to be charged properly for unethical financial gain and while staff in real estates lending arenas mingled terms to deceive y deliberate confusion consumers out of cash and homes while the USA Government provided Justice through President Obamas Inception and IRS Inception of Modifications which addressed these unethical profits in Reals Estate.  It was in 2009 that HARP, HAMP and Modifications were introduced to stop the victimization of Note Holders.

{"id":22,"llm_context":"Universal remote: A universal remote is a remote control that can be programmed to operate various brands of one or more types of consumer electronics devices.  Low-end universal remotes can only control a set number of devices determined by their manufacturer, while mid- and high-end universal remotes allow the user to program in new control codes to the remote.  Many remotes sold with various electronic include universal remote capabilities for other types of devices, which allow the remote to control other devices beyond the device it came with.  For example, a VCR remote may be programmed to operate various brands of televisions.\n\nRemote control: In electronics, a remote control is a component of an electronic device used to operate the device wirelessly from a distance.  For example, in consumer electronics, a remote control can be used to operate devices such as a television set, DVD player, or other home appliance, from a short distance.  A remote control is primarily a convenience feature for the user, and can allow operation of devices that are out of convenient reach for direct operation of controls.  In some cases, remote controls allow a person to operate a device that they otherwise would not be able to reach, as when a garage door opener is triggered from outside or when a Digital Light Processing projector that is mounted on a high ceiling is controlled by a person from the floor level.\n\nApple Remote: The Apple Remote is a remote control device released in or after October 2005 by Apple Inc. for use with a number of its products which use infrared capabilities.  The device was originally designed to interact with the Front Row media program on the iSight iMac G5 and is compatible with some later desktop and portable Macintosh computers.  The first three generations of Apple TV used the Apple Remote as their primary control mechanism.  It has now been replaced with the Siri Remote in the fourth generation.  Prior to the Apple Remote, Apple produced several nameless IR remotes for products such as the Macintosh TV, TV tuner expansion boards, and the PowerCD drive.\n\nSiri Remote: The Siri Remote is a remote control device released in tandem with the 4th Generation Apple TV at an Apple Keynote Address by CEO Tim Cook on October 26, 2015 by Apple Inc. The Remote is designed specifically to work with the always-on Siri capable Apple TV.  The device is a successor of the original Apple Remote.  It is also compatible with the Apple TV 4K.\n\nNetSupport Manager: NetSupport Manager is a Windows-centric cross-platform remote control software, allowing remote screen control and systems management from a Windows or Windows Mobile device of Windows, Mac, Linux, Solaris and Mobile devices.  It was first released for DOS only networks in 1989.  It supports thumbnail display of unlimited remote systems (since version 10), and allows navigation between remote systems in a manner similar to a KVM switch.  Functionality includes file transfers, chat, and hardware\/software inventory including software updates. Fewer features are supported for Linux and Mac clients.  In 2012 NetSupport introduced new software versions allowing Remote Control from iOS and Android tablets and smartphones as well as a new Mac OS Control.  Version 12 was released in October 2013, which extended platform support to include ChromeOS clients.  Mobile Remote Control from iOS and Android was also extended with additional capabilities.  All versions of NetSupport Manager require the pre-installation of the software on both the local (Control) and remote (Client) computers\/devices prior to use.\n\nFront Row (software): Front Row is a discontinued media center software application for Apple's Macintosh computers and Apple TV for navigating and viewing video, photos, podcasts, and music from a computer, optical disc, or the Internet through a 10-foot user interface (similar to Windows Media Center and Kodi).  The software relies on iTunes and iPhoto and is controlled by an Apple Remote or the keyboard function keys.  The first version was released October 2005, with two major revisions since.  Front Row was removed and discontinued in Mac OS X 10.7.\n\nApple Watch: Apple Watch (stylized as \uf8ffWATCH) is a line of smartwatches developed, designed, and marketed by Apple Inc. It incorporates fitness tracking and health-oriented capabilities with integration with iOS and other Apple products and services.  The original generation of the device was available in four variants: Apple Watch Sport, Apple Watch, Apple Watch Herm\u00e8s, and Apple Watch Edition; each distinguished by different combinations of cases and first- or third-party interchangeable bands.  Apple Watch relies on a wirelessly connected iPhone to perform many of its default functions such as calling and texting.  It is compatible with the iPhone 5 or later models running iOS 8.2 or later, through the use of Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.  Announced by Apple CEO Tim Cook in September 2014, the device was released in April 24, 2015.  The Apple Watch quickly became the best-selling wearable device with the supply of 4.2 million smartwatches in the second quarter of the 2015 fiscal year.  The second generation of Apple Watch, released in September 2016, includes two tiers: Apple Watch Series 2 and Apple Watch Series 1, which includes the S1P chip, but is otherwise identical to the original.  The Series 3 was announced at a presentation at Apple Park on September 12, 2017 and was released on September 22, 2017.\n\nMacScan: MacScan is an anti-malware utility for Apple's Mac OS X developed by SecureMac.

In addition, the application scans for remote administration programs, like Apple Remote Desktop, allowing users to verify that such programs are installed only with their authorization.\n\nTrainmaster Command Control: Trainmaster Command (TMCC) is Lionel's electronic control system for O scale 3-rail model trains and toy trains that mainly ran from 1994 to 2006.  Conceptually it is similar to Digital Command Control (DCC), the industry's open standard used by HO scale and other 2-rail DC trains.  It has one advantage over DCC, in that TMCC-equipped locomotives can run simultaneously with non-TMCC locomotives and Lionel Legacy engines as well as LionChief and LionChief Plus equipped locomotives.  The latter require a dedicated remote controller.  MTH Corporation's DCS controller can be configured to control TMCC locomotives, and all four systems (TMCC, Legacy, LionChief\/LionChief+ and DCS) can be operated on the same track simultaneously.  Each simply requires a constant track voltage (18 volts).  TMCC\/Legacy \"broadcasts\" it's signal to the antenna on the locomotives which listen for signals that first identify the particular locomotive by number and then it issues given commands as to speed, direction, sounds, lighting and other features.  DCS performs similar functions but transmits a carrier over the rails which are picked up through the locomotive's electrical pickup contacts.  While TMCC\/Legacy and DCS remote controls relay operator commands to a device that transmits them to the train (Command Base or Track Interface Unit), LionChief\/LionChief+ also issue remote control commands but the remote and locomotive are married and each locomotive requires a separate remote control.  This system requires no additional wiring as the control is directly \"narrowcast\" to the locomotive in the same way as a television remote control or garage door opener functions.  In 2017, Lionel released a universal remote for LionChief+ that will learn addresses for up to three locos at a time, simplifying the operation of multiple trains.\n\nApple Remote Desktop: Apple Remote Desktop (ARD) is a Macintosh application produced by Apple Inc., first released on March 14, 2002, that replaced a similar product called \"Apple Network Assistant\".  Aimed at computer administrators responsible for large numbers of computers and teachers who need to assist individuals or perform group demonstrations, Apple Remote Desktop allows users to remotely control or monitor other computers over a network.","question":"Aside from the Apple Remote, what other device can control the program Apple Remote was originally designed to interact with?","answer":"keyboard function keys"}

Information in the St. Helens local history archives states that sandstone quarrying began here as early as 1730.  As the quarry expanded, the cost of purchasing land to open cast mine it increased, so it was decided to opt for a different method.  Instead of quarrying out the stone, they would mine it out, following a seam of stone until it ran out.  This resulted in the network of caves, tunnels and shafts we see today.  Rainford Delph is listed as a Colliery by 1854, under the ownership of Charles Howarth or Yorkshire Charlie as he was known locally by 1880.  Mining finally ceased and the woods and caverns were used as a game reserve by the Earl of Derby until 1939, when they became a storage facility for ammunition for the anti-aircraft position at Crank.  After the war, the caverns ceased use as a game reserve.  Today, Crank Caverns are not officially open to the public and due to their increasing instability, attempts have been made to close access to the caverns and tunnels themselves.

He is today best remembered for the Kornilov Affair, an unsuccessful endeavor in August\/September 1917 that purported to strengthen Alexander Kerensky's Provisional Government, but which led to Kerensky eventually having Kornilov arrested and charged with attempting a coup d'\u00e9tat, and ultimately undermined the rule of Kerensky; strengthening the claims and power of the soviets, and the Bolshevik party.\n\nLeft-wing uprisings against the Bolsheviks: The left-wing uprisings against the Bolsheviks were a series of rebellions and uprisings against the Bolsheviks by rival left-wing parties that started soon after the October Revolution, continued through the Russian Civil War, and lasted into the first few years of Soviet rule.  They were led or supported by left-wing groups such as some factions of the Socialist Revolutionary Party, Left Socialist Revolutionaries, Mensheviks, and anarchists.  The uprisings started in 1918 and continued during and after the Civil War until around 1924.  The Bolsheviks increasingly abandoned attempts to invite these groups to join the government and instead suppressed them with force.\n\nLouise Bryant: Louise Bryant (December 5, 1885 \u2013 January 6, 1936) was an American feminist, political activist, and journalist best known for her sympathetic coverage of Russia and the Bolsheviks during the Russian Revolution.  Bryant, who married writer John Reed, her second husband, in 1916, wrote about Russian leaders such as Katherine Breshkovsky, Maria Spiridonova, Alexander Kerensky, Vladimir Lenin, and Leon Trotsky.  Her news stories, distributed by Hearst during and after her trips to Petrograd and Moscow, appeared in newspapers across the United States and Canada in the years immediately following World War I.  A collection of articles from her first trip was published in book form as \"Six Red Months in Russia\" in 1918.  During the next year, she defended the revolution in testimony before the Overman Committee, a Senate subcommittee established to investigate Bolshevik influence in the United States.  Later in 1919, she undertook a nationwide speaking tour to encourage public support of the Bolsheviks and to denounce armed U.S. intervention in Russia.\n\nBattle of Romanovka: The Battle of Romanovka was fought in June 1919 during the Russian Civil War.  Russian Bolsheviks of Yakov Triapitsyn launched a surprise attack on an American army camp at Romanovka, Siberia near Vladivostok.  As a result of the engagement, the attacks were repelled.  Romanovka and the Suchan Valley Campaign that followed were the final major engagements of the Russian Civil War involving the United States.  Battles would later break out again between the Americans and Bolsheviks, as well as the Cossacks, on much smaller scales.  Likewise, the Americans were invariably victorious.\n\nKerensky\u2013Krasnov uprising: Kerensky\u2013Krasnov uprising was an attempt by Alexander Kerensky to regain power after the Bolsheviks overthrew his Provisional Government in Petrograd.\n\nRussian Civil War: The Russian Civil War (Russian: \u0413\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0434\u0430\u0301\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0432\u043e\u0439\u043d\u0430\u0301 \u0432 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0301\u0438 , \"Grazhdanskaya voyna v Rossiyi\" ; November 1917 \u2013 October 1922) was a multi-party war in the former Russian Empire immediately after the Russian Revolutions of 1917, as many factions vied to determine Russia's political future.  The two largest combatant groups were the Red Army, fighting for the Bolshevik form of socialism led by Vladimir Lenin, and the loosely allied forces known as the White Army, which included diverse interests favoring monarchism, capitalism and alternative forms of socialism, each with democratic and antidemocratic variants.  In addition, rival militant socialists and nonideological Green armies fought against both the Bolsheviks and the Whites.  Eight foreign nations intervened against the Red Army, notably the Allied Forces and the pro-German armies.  The Red Army defeated the White Armed Forces of South Russia in Ukraine and the army led by Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak in Siberia in 1919.  The remains of the White forces commanded by Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel were beaten in Crimea and evacuated in late 1920.  Lesser battles of the war continued on the periphery for two more years, and minor skirmishes with the remnants of the White forces in the Far East continued well into 1923.  The war ended in 1923 in the sense that Red control of the newly formed Soviet Union was now assured, although armed national resistance in Central Asia was not completely crushed until 1934.  There were an estimated 7,000,000\u201312,000,000 casualties during the war, mostly civilians.  The Russian Civil War has been described by some as the greatest national catastrophe that Europe had yet seen.\n\nTimofey Samsonov: Timofey Petrovich Samsonov (Russian: \u0422\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0444\u0435\u0439 \u041f\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0421\u0430\u043c\u0441\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432 ) (9 May 1888 \u2013 28 October 1955) was a Soviet politician and veteran of the Russian Civil War.

{"id":40,"llm_context":"Teddy Roosevelt Terrier: The Teddy Roosevelt Terrier is a small to medium-sized American hunting terrier.  Lower-set with shorter legs, more muscular, and heavier bone density than its cousin the American Rat Terrier.  There is much diversity in the history of the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier breed and it shares a common early history with the American Rat Terrier, Fox Paulistinha and Tenterfield Terrier.  It is said the Rat Terrier background stems from the terriers or other dogs that were brought over by early English and other working class immigrants.  Since the breed was a farm, hunting and utility dog there was little to no planned breeding other than breeding dogs with agreeable traits to each other in order to produce the desired work ethic in the dog.  It is assumed that the Feist (dog), Bull Terrier, Smooth Fox Terrier, Manchester Terrier, Whippet, Italian Greyhound, the now extinct English White Terrier, Turnspit dog and or Wry Legged Terrier all share in the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier's ancestry.  These early Ratting Terriers were then most likely bred to the Beagle or Beagle cross bred dogs (for increased scenting ability) and other dogs.  Maximizing the influences from these various breeds provides the modern Teddy Roosevelt Terrier with a keen sense of awareness and prey drive, an acute sense of smell and a very high intellect.  Although they tend to be aloof with strangers they are devoted companion dogs with a strong desire to please and be near their owners side at all times.\n\nManchester Terrier: The Manchester Terrier is a breed of dog of the smooth-haired terrier type.\n\nFeist (dog): A Feist is a small hunting dog, descended from the terriers brought over to the United States by English miners and other working class immigrants.  These terriers probably included crosses between the Smooth Fox Terrier, the Manchester Terrier and the now extinct English White Terrier.  These dogs were used as ratters, and gambling on their prowess in killing rats was a favorite hobby of their owners.  Some of these dogs have been crossed with Whippets or Italian Greyhounds (for speed) and Beagles (for hunting ability) - extending the family to include a larger variety of purpose than the original ratter, or Rat Terrier.\n\nEnglish Setter: The English Setter is a medium size breed of dog.  It is part of the Setter family, which includes the red Irish Setters, Irish Red and White Setters, and black-and-tan Gordon Setters.  The mainly white body coat is of medium length with long silky fringes on the back of the legs, under the belly and on the tail.  The coat features flecks of colour, and the different colour varieties are referred to as belton.\n\nRusskiy Toy: The Russian Toy (also known as the Russian Toy Terrier, and in Russia as the Russkiy Toy, Toychik,Russian: \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0442\u043e\u0439, \u0422\u043e\u0439\u0447\u0438\u043a ) is a very small breed of dog originally bred in Russia from the English Toy Terrier which is known today as the Manchester Terrier.  There are two types of coats in the breed: smooth coat and long coat.  The smooth-coated variety was previously known as the Russian Toy Terrier and long-coated as the Moscow Long Haired Toy Terrier.  Both were brought together under the same Russian Toy Terrier name in 1988 and the \"Terrier\" was dropped from the name when the breed was added in 2006 to the official list of breeds registered with the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale and has been registered in the Foundation Stock Service of the American Kennel Club since 2008, allowed to compete in AKC companion events since 2010.  The first official breed standard of the two varieties was written in 1966 in Russia.\n\nViol: The viol , viola da gamba ] , or (informally) gamba, is any one of a family of bowed, fretted and stringed instruments with hollow wooden bodies and pegboxes where the tension on the strings can be increased or decreased to adjust the pitch of each of the strings.  Frets on the viol are usually made of gut, tied on the fingerboard around the instrument's neck, to enable the performer to stop the strings more cleanly.  Frets improve consistency of intonation and lend the stopped notes a tone which better matches the open strings.  Viols first appeared in Spain in the mid to late 15th century and were most popular in the Renaissance and Baroque (1600-1750) periods.  Early ancestors include the Arabic \"rebab\" and the medieval European vielle, but later, more direct possible ancestors include the Venetian \"viole\" and the 15th- and 16th-century Spanish \"vihuela\", a 6-course plucked instrument tuned like a lute (and also like a present-day viol) that looked like but was quite distinct from (at that time) the 4-course guitar (an earlier chordophone).\n\nCollie: The collie is a distinctive type of herding dog, including many related landraces and standardised breeds.  The type originated in Scotland and Northern England.  The collie is a medium-sized, fairly lightly built dog, with a pointed snout.  Many types have a distinctive white pattern over the shoulders.  Collies are very active and agile, and most types of collies have a very strong herding instinct.  Collie breeds have spread through many parts of the world (especially Australia and North America) and have diversified into many varieties, sometimes with mixture from other dog types.  Some collie breeds have remained as working dogs, used for herding cattle, sheep and other livestock, while others are kept as pets, show dogs or for dog sports, in which they display great agility, stamina and trainability.  While the AKC has a breed they call \"Collie\", in fact collie dogs are a distinctive type of herding dog including many related landraces and formal breeds.  There are usually major distinctions between show dogs and those bred for herding trials or dog sports.  They typically display great agility, stamina and trainability and more importantly sagacity.\n\nScotch Collie: The Scotch Collie is a landrace breed of dog which originated from the highland regions of Scotland.  The breed consisted of both the long-haired (now known as Rough) Collie and the short-haired (now known as Smooth) Collie.  It is generally believed to have descended from a variety of ancient herding dogs, some dating back to the Roman occupation, which may have included Roman Cattle Dogs, Native Celtic Dogs and Viking Herding Spitzes.  Other ancestors include the Gordon and Irish Setters.\n\nToy Manchester Terrier: The Toy Manchester Terrier is a breed of dog, categorized as a terrier.  The breed was bred down in size in North America from the Manchester Terrier, and is placed in the Toy Group by the American Kennel Club and the Canadian Kennel Club (the Manchester Terrier is placed in the Terrier Group.)  Neither the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale nor The Kennel Club recognize a Toy variety of the Manchester Terrier.\n\nFlorence Nagle: Florence Nagle (26 October 1894\u00a0\u2013 30 October 1988) was a trainer and breeder of racehorses, a breeder of pedigree dogs, and an active feminist.  Nagle purchased her first Irish Wolfhound in 1913, and went on to own or breed twenty-one United Kingdom Champions.  Best in Show at Crufts in 1960 was awarded to Sulhamstead Merman, who was bred, owned and exhibited by Nagle.  She also competed successfully in field trials with Irish Setters, from the 1920s until the mid-1960s resulting in eighteen Field Trial Champions.  The male dog who was a linchpin in the 1970s revival of the Irish Red and White Setter breed was descended from one of Nagle's Irish Setters.","question":"Which dog's ancestors include Gordon and Irish Setters: the Manchester Terrier or the Scotch Collie?","answer":"Scotch Collie"}

{"id":43,"llm_context":"First Italo-Ethiopian War: The First Italo-Ethiopian War was fought between Italy and Ethiopia from 1895 to 1896.  It originated from a disputed treaty which, the Italians claimed, turned the country into an Italian protectorate.  Italy was supported by the two other triple alliance members Germany and Austria.  Much to their surprise, they found that Ethiopian ruler Menelik II, rather than being opposed by some of his traditional enemies, was supported by them, so the Italian army, invading Ethiopia from Italian Eritrea in 1893, faced a more united front than they expected.  In addition, Ethiopia was supported by Russia, an Orthodox Christian nation like Ethiopia with military advisers, army training, and the sale of weapons for Ethiopian forces during the war.  Ethiopia was also supported diplomatically by the United Kingdom and France in order to prevent Italy from becoming a colonial competitor.  Full-scale war broke out in 1895, with Italian troops having initial success until Ethiopian troops counterattacked Italian positions and besieged the Italian fort of Meqele, forcing its surrender.  Italian defeat came about after the Battle of Adwa, where the Ethiopian army dealt the heavily outnumbered Italians a decisive blow and forced their retreat back into Eritrea.\n\nEthiopia\u2013Japan relations: Ethiopia\u2013Japan relations are the international relations between Ethiopia and Japan.  Both were nations with an ancient history which successfully repulsed European military advances to dominate them, Ethiopia at the Battle of Adwa, and Japan at the Battle of Tsushima, and as a result both nations considered each other potential allies prior to World War II.\n\nOutline of Ethiopia: Ethiopia is a landlocked sovereign country located in the Horn of Africa.  Ethiopia is bordered by Eritrea to the north, Sudan to the west, South Sudan to the south-west, Kenya to the south, Somalia to the east and Djibouti to the north-east.  Ethiopia is one of the oldest countries in the world and Africa's second-most populous nation.  Ethiopia has yielded some of humanity's oldest traces, making the area important in the history of human evolution.  Recent studies claim that the vicinity of present-day Addis Ababa was the point from which human beings migrated around the world.  Ethiopian dynastic history traditionally began with the reign of Emperor Menelik I in 1000 BC.  The roots of the Ethiopian state are similarly deep, dating with unbroken continuity to at least the Aksumite Empire (which adopted the name \"Ethiopia\" in the 4th century) and its predecessor state, D`mt (with early 1st millennium BC roots).  After a period of decentralized power in the 18th and early 19th centuries known as the Zemene Mesafint (\"Era of the Judges\/Princes\"), the country was reunited in 1855 by Kassa Hailu, who became Emperor Tewodros II, beginning Ethiopia's modern history.  Ethiopia's borders underwent significant territorial expansion to its modern borders for the rest of the century, especially by Emperor Menelik II and Ras Gobena, culminating in its victory over the Italians at the Battle of Adwa in 1896 with the military leadership of Ras Makonnen, and ensuring its sovereignty and freedom from colonization.  It was brutally occupied by Benito Mussolini's Fascist Italy from 1936 to 1941, ending with its liberation by British Empire and Ethiopian Patriot forces.\n\nEphigenia of Ethiopia: Saint Ephigenia of Ethiopia or Iphigenia of Ethiopia (Spanish: \"Efig\u00eania\" ; Portuguese: \"Ifig\u00eania\" ; French: \"Iphig\u00e9nie\" ; ), also called Iphigenia of Abyssinia (1st century), is a folk saint whose life is told in the \"Golden Legend\" as a virgin converted to Christianity and then consecrated to God by St. Matthew the Apostle, who was spreading the Gospel to the region of \"Ethiopia\", which in this case is understood to be located in the regions south of the Caspian Sea, either in one of the provinces of Mesopotamia (Assyria and Babylon), or in Ancient Armenia (Colchis).\n\nHerbert S. Lewis: Herbert S. Lewis (born May 8, 1934) is Professor Emeritus of Anthropology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where he taught from 1963 to 1998.  He has conducted extensive field research.  In Ethiopia, Lewis studied both the history of the Oromo (Galla) Kingdom of Jimma Abba Jifar and the lives of contemporary Oromos from 1958\u201360 and in 1965\u201366.  (Many of his ethnographic photographs are visible in the University of Wisconsin's Digital Library.  See the link to Africa Focus below).  His work in Ethiopia was concerned above all with political leadership and community organization as well as ethnohistory and culture history.  The book, originally titled A Galla Monarchy: Jimma Abba Jifar, Ethiopia, 1830-1932, is a study of the nature of the monarchy, the sources of the ruler's power, as well as its origins.  The study in 1965-66 centered on community life and the leadership of spirit mediums, k'allu, who effectively organized religious life and conflict resolution, and provided a degree of political leadership for rural districts.\n\nBattle of Adwa: The Battle of Adwa (Amharic: \u12a0\u12f5\u12cb; Amharic translated: Adowa, or sometimes by the Italian name \"Adua\") was fought on 2 March 1896\/Yekatit 23, 1889 according to Ethiopian calendar between the Ethiopian Empire and the Kingdom of Italy near the town of Adwa, Ethiopia, in Tigray.  This climactic battle of the First Italo-Ethiopian War, was a decisive defeat for Italy and secured Ethiopian sovereignty.\n\nP'ent'ay: P'ent'ay (from Amharic: , also transliterated as Pentay or Pente) is an Amharic and Tigrinya language term for a Christian of a Protestant denomination, widely used in Ethiopia and among Ethiopians and Eritreans living abroad.  The term was coined in the late 1960s and was used as a pejorative for churches that believed in the Pentecostal experience.  Today, it is used to describe local Protestant Christians who are not members of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo and Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo churches.  The term \"P'ent'ay\" is a shortening of the word \"Pentecostal\"; however, it is widely used when referring to all Protestant Christians whether they are actual Pentecostals or not.  Some Orthodox will also apply the term to the small Catholic population of Ethiopia.  The equivalent rendition in many other languages is Evangelicals.  The four major Evangelical denominations in Ethiopia are: the Kale Heywet (Word of Life); Mekane Yesus (Place of Jesus), Lutheran; Mulu Wongel (Full Gospel) and Meserete Kristos (meaning \"Christ foundation\") or Mennonite.  Some P'ent'ay communities - especially Mekane Yesus - have been influenced by the Orthodox Tewahedo Church, which represents mainstream, traditional Ethiopian Christianity.  But for the most part they are very Pentecostal in their worship and theology.\n\nGiuseppe Arimondi: Giuseppe Edoardo Arimondi, OSML, OMS, OCI (Savigliano, 26 April 1846 \u2013 Adwa, 1 March 1896) was an Italian general, mostly known for his role during the First Italo-Ethiopian War.  He was one of the few European commanders who gained a victory over the Mahdists before Kitchener's Expedition, soundly defeating them at Agordat in 1893.  After a long and successfull colonial service, he died in combat at Adwa, and was posthumously awarded the Gold Medal of Military Valor.\n\nSecond Battle of Agordat: The Second Battle of Agordat was fought in late December 1893, between Italian colonial troops and Mahdists from the Sudan.  Emir Ahmed Ali campaigned against the Italian forces in eastern Sudan and led about 10\u201312,000 men east from Kassala.  This force encountered 2,400 Italians and their Eritrean askaris at Agordat, west of Asmara, commanded by Colonel Arimondi.  Over 1,000 Dervishes, including the Emir, were killed in severe fighting.  The outcome of the battle constituted:\n\nTreaty of Addis Ababa: The Treaty of Addis Ababa, signed 23 October 1896, formally ended the First Italo\u2013Ethiopian War on terms mostly favorable to Ethiopia.  This treaty superseded a secret agreement between Ethiopia and Italy negotiated days after the decisive Battle of Adwa in March of the same year, in which Ethiopian forces commanded by Menelik II defeated the Italians.  The most important concession the Italians made was the abrogation of the Treaty of Wuchale and recognizing Ethiopia as an independent country.","question":"The battle in which Giuseppe Arimondi lost his life secured what for Ethiopia?","answer":"sovereignty"}

{"id":46,"llm_context":"Trash Box: Trash Box is a 5-CD box set of mid-1960s garage rock and psychedelic rock recordings, primarily by American bands.  This box set is similar to the earlier \"Pebbles Box\" (a 5-LP box set) and includes almost all of the same recordings in that box set (and in the same order), along with numerous bonus tracks at the end of each disc.  Supposedly, \"the Trash Box\" collects the first five volumes of the CDs in the Pebbles series (i.e., those released by AIP Records, not to be confused with the 4 earlier CDs that were issued by ESD Records).  However, as is generally true of the CD reissues of these five volumes (though not nearly to the same extent), the tracks differ significantly on all five discs as compared to both the original Pebbles LPs and the later Pebbles CDs in the corresponding volumes; and the surf rock rarities on \"Pebbles, Volume 4\" have been eschewed entirely.  Overall, there are 109 tracks in the box set (excluding the introduction and ending cuts) as compared to 101 songs on the individual CDs and 72 tracks in the \"Pebbles Box\".  Although most of the recordings on \"the Trash Box\" were released at some point on one of the individual Pebbles albums, several of the songs have not appeared elsewhere in the Pebbles series.  Inexplicably, one of these songs is the well-known hit \"I Fought the Law (but the Law Won)\" by the Bobby Fuller Four (on Disc Four) \u2013 which is also included in the \"Pebbles Box\" \u2013 in place of the much rarer \"Wine Wine Wine\" by Bobby Fuller that appears on \"Pebbles, Volume 2\".\n\nChrome, Smoke &amp; BBQ: Chrome, Smoke & BBQ is a box set by American blues-rock band ZZ Top, released in 2003.  At the time of release, this box set was notable for using the original mixes for all of the tracks from the band's first five albums for the first time on the CD format.  This box set, and the companion release \"Rancho Texicano\", were the only two CD releases which featured original mixes from \"ZZ Top's First Album\", \"Rio Grande Mud\", and \"Tejas\", aside from 1977's \"The Best of ZZ Top\" which features two tracks from \"Rio Grande Mud\" and one track from \"First Album\". \" Tres Hombres\" and \"Fandango! \" were reissued in their original mixes in 2006, and in 2013, Warner Brothers released the CD box set 'The Complete Studio Albums 1970-1990' which includes the first ten ZZ Top studio albums, all with the original mixes.\n\nBack to Mono (1958\u20131969): Back to Mono (1958\u20131969) is a box set (4 compact discs or 5 vinyl LPs) compilation of the recorded work of record producer Phil Spector, through the 1960s, released in 1991 by ABKCO as #7118-2.  The first track, \"To Know Him Is to Love Him,\" released in 1958, features Spector performing as part of the group the Teddy Bears.  Initially a vinyl album-sized package, the box contained a booklet with photographs, complete song lyrics, discographical information, and a reproduction of the essay on Spector by Tom Wolfe, \"The First Tycoon of Teen.\"  The package also contained a small, round, red \"Back to Mono\" pin.\n\nLive in Japan (John Coltrane album): Live in Japan is a four-disc box set by American saxophonist John Coltrane and his last group, featuring the quintet of Coltrane, his wife\/pianist Alice, saxophonist\/bass clarinetist Pharoah Sanders, bassist Jimmy Garrison and drummer Rashied Ali.  The 4-CD set compiles all the music issued as three albums in the seventies by Impulse! ; \"Concert In Japan\" (1973, US 2-LP, electronically processed for compatible quadrophonic\/stereo), \"Coltrane In Japan\" (1974, Japan 3-LP (side six is blank), mono) and \"Second Night In Tokyo\" (1976, Japan 3-LP (side six contains an interview, mono).  (Some of this material was also reissued as two 2-LP sets in 1980 by MCA under the titles \"Coltrane In Tokyo Vol.  1\" and \"Coltrane In Tokyo Vol.  2\") The first CD issues were by Impulse!  Japan as two 2-CD sets: \"Live In Japan Vol.  1\" (same as \"Coltrane In Japan\") and \"Live In Japan Vol.  2\" (same as \"Second Night In Tokyo\").  The US 4-CD edition includes both of these volumes, with identical mastering from the original mono tapes.  The side six interview from \"Second Night In Tokyo\" has never been reissued on any CD edition.\n\nNashville Rebel (box set): Nashville Rebel is a box set by Waylon Jennings, released on RCA Records through Legacy Recordings in 2006.  According to Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine, it is \"\"the first comprehensive, multi-label Waylon Jennings retrospective ever assembled\", comprising ninety-two songs recorded between 1958 and 1994, with selections from the majority of the singer's recording career.  The first track of the box set is the Buddy Holly-produced \"Jole Blon,\" released in 1958, while the last is \"I Do Believe,\" a song produced by Don Was that was included on The Highwaymen's 1995 release, \"The Road Goes on Forever\".  The other material on the box set covers Jennings' career chronologically, with songs ranging from his years on RCA's roster to later compositions from his short-lived stay at Epic Records; it ignores, however, the tracks from Jennings albums released on independent labels.  The majority of the singer's charting singles are included in the package, as are collaborations such as \"Mamas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys\" with Willie Nelson and \"Highwayman\" with The Highwaymen.  A notable addition is the previously unreleased \"The Greatest Cowboy of Them All,\" a 1978 duet with Johnny Cash which was later recorded by Cash alone for \"A Believer Sings the Truth\" (1979) and \"The Mystery of Life\" (1991); two others, \"It's Sure Been Fun\" and \"People in Dallas Got Hair,\" had never been released in the United States.  \"Nashville Rebel\" was released on four CDs, with a 140-page booklet and liner notes by Rich Keinzle and Lenny Kaye.\n\nRadiohead Box Set: Radiohead Box Set is a box set of the first six studio albums and one live album by the English rock band Radiohead, released on 10 December 2007.

The box set peaked at #95 in Canada's album charts.\n\nMono Masters: Mono Masters is a compilation album by the Beatles, and is an alternate, all-mono version of the album \"Past Masters\".  \"Mono Masters\" was originally a two-CD set included as part of \"The Beatles in Mono\" box set.  The premise of this box set was to compile only Beatles material which was released or prepared for release with a dedicated mono mix (the set excludes later material mixed and released only in stereo, and material whose mono version was simply created as an equal mix of the two channels of the stereo version).  As a result, the track listing for \"Mono Masters\" differs from \"Past Masters\" on the second half of disc two, omitting some later songs that never had a mono mix (\"Old Brown Shoe\", \"The Ballad of John and Yoko\" and \"Let It Be\"), and adding several songs released on stereo-only albums that had unreleased mono mixes.  Tracks 9\u201312 and 15 were prepared in March 1969 for release as a 7\" mono \"Yellow Submarine\" EP, two months after the release of the similarly titled soundtrack album, but the project was scrapped, although the EP was mastered.  Subsequently, the tracks were only released in stereo (and in an electronically produced mono mixdown, or \"fold-down\", of the stereo mix), while the true mono mixes remained unreleased.  \"Get Back\" (with B-side \"Don't Let Me Down\") was the final Beatles single mixed for mono format.  It was released in the UK in mono, though the US release was in stereo.  Thus, the songs that were originally released on stereo singles in the UK are omitted on this release.\n\nLed Zeppelin Boxed Set 2: Led Zeppelin Boxed Set 2 is a double album released by Atlantic Records on 21 September 1993.  This box set features the rest of the English rock band Led Zeppelin's catalogue not included in the 1990 4-CD box set \"Led Zeppelin\", all digitally remastered, including the previously unreleased studio track \"Baby Come On Home\".  A 54-page booklet was also included with the release.  Between this box set and the 4-CD box set every track from the band's nine studio albums are featured along with two BBC live recordings; the band's only non-LP b-side; and one studio outtake.\n\nTo Know Him Is to Love Him: \"To Know Him Is to Love Him\" is a song written by Phil Spector, inspired by words on his father's tombstone, \"To Know Him Was To Love Him.\"  It was first recorded by the only vocal group of which he was a member, the Teddy Bears.  Their recording spent three weeks at No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 singles chart in 1958, while reaching No. 2 on UK's \"New Musical Express\" chart.  Peter & Gordon and Bobby Vinton later had hits with the song, with its title and lyrics changed to \"To Know You Is to Love You\".  In 1987, the song was resurrected by Dolly Parton, Linda Ronstadt and Emmylou Harris, whose \"Trio\" recording topped the U.S. country singles charts.  The song is in 12\/8 time.\n\nThe Doors: Vinyl Box Set: The Doors: Vinyl Box Set is the seventh box set for the rock band The Doors.  It is a 7 record set of the original 6 Doors albums, remastered in stereo from the original analogue tapes with a mono version of the debut album.  Artwork, packaging, and inner sleeves are replicas of the originals from 1967-1971.  The box set was originally planned to be released in October 2007, but was delayed due to a problem with the vinyl, as well as other problems in the production of the box set.  The delay ran until February 2008.  Reasons for the delay included faulty test pressings, inferiority of the L.A. Woman artwork, and bad compounds in the vinyl that was used first, which caused a search for a new source of virgin vinyl.","question":"Who is the writer of this song that was inspired by words on a tombstone and was the first track on the box set Back to Mono?","answer":"Phil Spector"}

It is an annual herb growing up to a meter in height with a hairy, partially glandular stem.  The lance-shaped leaves are up to 12 centimeters long near the base of the plant and smaller farther up.  The flower is enclosed in an inflated, hairy, glandular calyx of fused sepals which is ridged with many veins.  It is open at the top, revealing five bright pink petals.\n\nSilene: Silene is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae.  Containing approximately 700 species, it is the largest genus in the family.  Common names include campion (which is shared with the related genus \"Lychnis\") and catchfly.  Many \"Silene\" species are widely distributed, particularly in the northern hemisphere.\n\nSilene stenophylla: Silene stenophylla is a species of flowering plant in the family Caryophyllaceae.  Commonly called narrow-leafed campion, it is a species in the genus \"Silene\".  It grows in the Arctic tundra of far eastern Siberia and the mountains of Northern Japan.

In general, it is a perennial herb growing from a caudex, appearing matlike, decumbent, or erect, with stems a few centimeters to over half a meter long.  It is usually hairy in texture, with upper parts bearing sticky glandular hairs.  The leaves are lance-shaped, oppositely arranged in pairs, and a few centimeters in length, upper leaves usually smaller than lower.  Flowers may occur in a cyme at the top of the stem, or in leaf axils, or both.  Each is encapsulated in a hairy, veined calyx of fused sepals.  The petals are white with two lobes at the tips.  The plant is dioecious with male and female plants producing different flowers.  The male and female flower types look the same externally; the stamens are reduced in female plants and the stigmas are reduced in the male.\n\nSilene suksdorfii: Silene suksdorfii is a species of flowering plant in the pink family known by the common names Suksdorf's silene, Suksdorf's catchfly and Cascade alpine campion.

It is native to the Americas, where it is widespread throughout North America and parts of South America.  It is known in Europe as an introduced species.\n\nSex determination in Silene: \"Silene\" are a flowering plant that evolved a dioecious reproductive system.  This is made possible through heteromorphic sex chromosomes expressed as XY.  \"Silene\" recently evolved sex chromosomes 5-10 million years ago and are widely used by geneticists and biologists to study the mechanisms of sex determination since they are one of only 39 species across 14 families of angiosperm that possess sex-determining genes.  \"Silene\" are studied because of their ability to produce offspring with a plethora of reproductive systems.  The common inference drawn from such studies is that the sex of the offspring is determined by the Y chromosome.","question":"Are Ferocactus and Silene both types of plant?","answer":"yes"}
